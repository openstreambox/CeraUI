/**
 * Boot readiness surface (S6 boot fail-soft).
 *
 * Tracks whether any NON-CRITICAL boot init degraded (failed) during startup.
 * The device can be fully "up" — the WS control server bound, the operator
 * reachable — while still being "readiness-reduced": one or more optional
 * subsystems failed to initialise. Operators (and a systemd watchdog) need to
 * see that distinction rather than guess from a half-working UI.
 *
 * This is process-wide module state (same posture as the identity /
 * control-channel singletons). It is surfaced read-only on the local
 * `/api/health` endpoint via {@link module:observability} — LOCAL-ONLY, no
 * remote egress.
